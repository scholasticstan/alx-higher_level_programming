# Python - Almost a Circle!



Python - Almost a Circle is a project focused on creating a Python library for objects and classes that represent figures in a plane. This project is created from the book "Python - Almost a Circle" by Juan Carlos.



The project includes a set of objects and classes that represent basic figures such as rectangles, squares, circles, and triangles. Each figure has its own set of attributes and methods that allows you to manipulate them.



The project also includes a module that allows you to draw these figures and a module that allows you to save the figures in a file.
