<h1>Python Inheritance</h1>
<h3>meaning</h3>
<p>So imagine you have a big toy box full of different toys. Some toys are stuffed animals and some are toy cars. They are all different, but they are all still toys.



Inheritance is like when you have a special kind of toy that is a combination of two different toys. For example, you might have a stuffed animal toy car that is both a stuffed animal and a toy car. It has all the features of a stuffed animal (it's soft and cuddly) and all the features of a toy car (it has wheels and can be pushed around).



In programming, we can create a class for each type of toy (like a stuffed animal class or a toy car class). Then, we can create a new class for the stuffed animal toy car that "inherits" all the features of the stuffed animal class and the toy car class. This way, we don't have to write all the code for the stuffed animal toy car from scratch - we can just use all the code we already wrote for the stuffed animal and toy car classes and add any extra code that the stuffed animal toy car class needs.



I hope that helps!</p>
